### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Partner at [Tapestry.vc](https://tapestry.vc/) where I primarily focus on investing in enterprise software at pre-seed/seed stages. When I'm not investing, I'm writing code, developing games and standing in line at sneaker stores. 

Based in London and always up for grabbing coffee. Feel free to reach me [@alex__mackenzie](https://twitter.com/alex__mackenzie) / alex@tapestry.vc
