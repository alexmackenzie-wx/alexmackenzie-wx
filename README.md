### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Partner at [Tapestry.vc](https://tapestry.vc/) where I primarily focus on investing in enterprise software at pre-seed/seed stages. When I'm not investing, I'm writing code, documenting gtm/sales processes and standing in line at sneaker stores. 

Based in London and always up for grabbing coffee. Feel free to reach me [@alex__mackenzie](https://twitter.com/alex__mackenzie) / alex@tapestry.vc
